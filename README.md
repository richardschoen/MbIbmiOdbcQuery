# IBM i ODBC Query Helper Utility
This app is a utility for running one or more IBM i ODBC queries in a MDI (Multi-Document) Window. 

I don't use this instead of ACS Run SQL Script, but I will use it when I wqnt to run multiple DB2 SQL queries and have them in a single UI with multiple result windows open.

This app is a self-contained DotNet 10 app so it runs on Windows only. 

Simple unzip to a directory and run the app. 

Have fun.

# Pre-requisites
You need to install the IBM i Access Windows package which contains the ODBC driver. This app uses the IBM i Access ODBC Driver.
