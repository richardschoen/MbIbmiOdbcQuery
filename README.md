# IBM i ODBC Query Helper Utility
This is a FREE IBM i app or running one or more interactive IBM i ODBC queries in a MDI (Multi-Document) Window in a MS Windows environment. 

I don't use this instead of ACS Run SQL Scripts, but I plan to use it when I want to run multiple DB2 SQL queries and have them in a single UI with multiple result windows open.

This app is a self-contained DotNet 10 app so it runs on Windows only. 

Simply unzip to a directory and run the app. 

If you have questions or problems with the app feel or a feature request free to open an issue.

# Pre-requisites
You need to install the IBM i Access Windows package which contains the ODBC driver. This app uses the IBM i Access ODBC Driver.
